# python-poll
Simple Python + PSQL polling app  

Summary: Doing this as part of Udemy course on Python and SQL. As a bonus, I added a basic UI by asking ChatGPT to convert the terminal-only app, and it worked out pretty well! I didn't know Flask at all, but it worked out the box. (Just don't ask ChatGPT to do anything beyond basic styling). Flask reminds me a little of working with EJS with the % templates. I find it hard to learn by blindly following a tutorial, so adding the UI bit was nice because then I was forced to debug and figure out what was actually happening.
